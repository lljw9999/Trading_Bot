# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0-rc1] ‚Äì 2025-09-23

### Added
- **GitHub Actions test matrix** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) with staged jobs:
  - `unit`: `pytest -m "not integration and not soak"`
  - `integration`: spins up `docker-compose.ci.yml` services (Redis, API mock)
  - `soak` (scheduled cron): installs extras via `pip install .[ml,onnx,bandits]` and runs `pytest -m "soak"`
- `docker-compose.ci.yml` to provision CI redis + mock API services.
- `pyproject.toml` with optional dependency groups (`ml`, `onnx`, `bandits`).

### Changed
- **Executor safety**: `AlpacaExecutor` defaults to `dry_run=True` and refuses live mode unless `DRY_RUN=0` is explicitly set.
- **NOWNodes connector**: gated by `USE_NOWNODES=1` and silences legacy `websockets` warnings (pinned to `websockets==11.0.3`).
- **Layer 0 package init** tolerates disabled NOWNodes without import explosions.
- Updated core version constants and README badge to `v0.9.0-rc1`.
- Refreshed RUNBOOK with staged test matrix, environment toggles (`DRY_RUN`, `OPENAI_MOCK`, `REDIS_MOCK`, `USE_NOWNODES`).

### Fixed
- Clean CI logs by suppressing legacy `websockets` deprecation noise when NOWNodes is disabled.
- Extras install job prevents `ImportError` for optional ML/bandit/onnx modules.

## [0.4.1] ‚Äì 2025-09-23

### Added - Stabilization Sprint (Future_instruction.txt Phase 2)

#### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Reliability Improvements
- **Websockets Deprecation Handling**: Added `USE_NOWNODES` environment flag to gate websockets imports
  - Graceful fallback to simulation mode when websockets disabled
  - Pytest markers for NOWNodes tests with conditional skipping  
  - Eliminated deprecation warnings in local/CI runs by default
- **Executor Safety Audit**: Enhanced AlpacaExecutor with explicit prod guards
  - **BREAKING**: Now defaults to `dry_run=True` to prevent accidental real orders
  - Requires explicit `DRY_RUN=0` environment variable for live trading
  - Added warning messages for live trading mode activation

#### üß™ CI Test Strategy Enhancement  
- Implemented staged pytest matrix as specified in Future_instruction.txt:
  - **Stage 1**: Unit tests only (`pytest -m "not integration"`)
  - **Stage 2**: Full integration suite (Redis, API, connectors)  
  - **Stage 3**: Soak/long-running tests (nightly builds)
- Added timeout tuning and coverage thresholds to `pytest.ini`
- Created `run_ci_tests.sh` script for automated CI execution
- Enhanced pytest configuration with `--maxfail=5`, `--durations=20`, `--tb=short`

#### üìö Documentation Updates
- Updated **RUNBOOK.md** with comprehensive safety controls section
- Added testing strategy documentation with staged test matrix
- Documented environment toggles (`USE_NOWNODES`, `DRY_RUN`)
- Added coverage testing instructions and pytest markers reference

### Technical Implementation Details

#### New Environment Variables
- `USE_NOWNODES=1`: Enable NOWNodes websocket connections (default: 0)
- `DRY_RUN=0`: Enable live trading (default: 1, requires explicit setting)

#### New Pytest Markers  
- `nownodes`: Tests requiring USE_NOWNODES=1 and websockets library
- Enhanced existing markers for better CI categorization

#### Safety Features
- Prevents accidental real money orders in tests/dev environments
- Clear warnings for live trading mode activation
- Isolated test execution from live trading functionality

### Previous Sprint Achievements (Phase 1)
- ‚úÖ External service hardening with OpenAI/Redis mocks
- ‚úÖ Dependency gating for ML libraries (xgboost/lightgbm/onnx)
- ‚úÖ L2 order book depth with VWAP calculations and Kafka schema
- ‚úÖ Advanced risk management (VaR/CVaR + exchange haircuts + WORM audit)
- ‚úÖ Real prometheus metrics with proper histogram buckets and SLO monitoring
