- **Quantization Drift Check:** Ensures accuracy maintained (≤0.5% drift tolerance)
- **Economic Integration:** Cost gates now required for all ramp decisions

## 💰 Financial Impact

| Metric | Before M10 | After M10 | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Cost Ratio** | 89.4% | 58.0% | -31.4pp |
| **Infrastructure Cost/Day** | $95.50 | $45.88 | -52% |
| **Monthly Savings** | - | $1,488.68 | +$1,488.68 |
| **Ramp Gate Status** | BLOCKED | BLOCKED* | Cost improved |

*Still blocked due to 58% > 30% cap, but significant progress toward target

## 🎛️ Makefile Integration

```make
cost-prof:      # Profile GPU performance → artifacts/cost/
quantize:       # Run ONNX quantization → FP16 optimization  
idle-reaper:    # Test idle resource management
cost-pack:      # Collect all cost artifacts
```

## ⚠️ Current Status & Next Steps

### ✅ Successes
- **Cost reduction target EXCEEDED:** 52% > 40% target
- **Quantization accuracy maintained:** 0.12% drift < 0.5% tolerance
- **Ramp gates properly integrated** with cost validation
- **Comprehensive monitoring** established

### 🎯 Remaining Optimizations
- **Cost ratio still above 30% cap** (58% vs 30% target)
- **GPU compute utilization low** (1% - opportunity for better batching)
- **Pipeline efficiency** could be further optimized

### 🚀 Recommended Actions
1. **Deploy FP16 model immediately** to realize 52% cost savings in production
2. **Implement pipeline caching** to reduce feature computation costs
3. **Right-size GPU instances** based on profiling results
4. **Monitor cost gates** for 48h to validate stable operation
