## Prerequisites Checklist

- ✅ Data quality validation completed
- ✅ Feature engineering pipeline validated
- ✅ Training infrastructure provisioned
- ✅ Model validation suite prepared
- ✅ Deployment pipeline tested
- ✅ Rollback procedures verified
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting configured
- ✅ Stakeholder notifications prepared

## Success Criteria

- Model validation pass rate ≥ 95%
- Performance improvement over baseline ≥ 2%
- No critical alerts during 48h monitoring
- Successful A/B test with statistical significance
- Successful deployment to canary environment

## Risk Assessment

- Insufficient training data may lead to overfitting
- Training job failure due to infrastructure issues
- Data pipeline failures during training window
- Model performance regression
- Deployment pipeline failures
- Extended downtime during deployment

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Pre-Training Phase
1. Validate data quality and completeness
2. Check feature engineering pipeline
3. Provision training infrastructure
4. Set up monitoring and alerting

### 2. Training Phase
1. Execute training job with checkpointing
2. Monitor training metrics in real-time
3. Validate intermediate checkpoints
4. Generate training artifacts and logs

### 3. Post-Training Phase
1. Run comprehensive validation suite
2. Execute A/B testing framework
3. Generate model performance reports
4. Deploy to staging environment

### 4. Deployment Phase
1. Execute blue-green deployment
2. Monitor canary deployment metrics
3. Gradually increase traffic allocation
4. Monitor for performance regressions

### 5. Post-Deployment Phase
1. Monitor model performance for 48 hours
2. Generate deployment report
3. Update model documentation
4. Schedule next retraining cycle

## Emergency Procedures

- **Training Failure:** Restore from last checkpoint, investigate root cause
- **Performance Regression:** Immediate rollback to previous model version
- **Data Pipeline Failure:** Pause retraining, validate data integrity
- **Deployment Issues:** Execute rollback procedure, investigate offline
